## Resume/Portfolio 
This page is my responsive frontend playground and will evolve as I delve deeper into frontend development and design. I began this page during a Java full-stack bootcamp after we were introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I fell in love with JavaScript and really enjoy seeing the visual results of my code. Long before this, I went to art school for illustration & design so frontend development is really a merger of two of my passions. I will be adding in more functionality, visuals for projects, etc. in the future.

This portfolio/resume is my playground and will evolve as I delve deeper into web development and design! I began this page during a Java full-stack bootcamp after we were introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I really fell in love with web dev and love to see the visual results of my code. Looong before this, I went to art school for illustration & design so I see frontend as kind of like a merger of two of my passions- art and coding.
